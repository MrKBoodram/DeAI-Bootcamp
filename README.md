Welcome to my journey through the [Encode x DeAI Bootcamp](https://bootcamps.encode.club/bootcamp/deai-bootcamp#curriculum), a hands-on program designed to educate participants on how to build and deploy decentralized AI applications, at the interesection of Web3 development and machine learning.

This repository documents my progress, learning outcomes, and project work during the 8-week program. Some of this focus is on learning how to develop, train and run open-source models, understanding the evolving role of AI in blockchain ecosystems, and by creating agents to operate on-chain.

## 🚀 Final Project

The plan for my final deliverable will be an autonomous DeFi AI trading agent. This will include:

- A complete architecture (strategy, model, web3 interface)
- Backtesting and simulation results
- Deployment and monitoring dashboard
- Leaderboard performance summary
- Post-mortem reflection and learnings

➡️ _More details will be added in `/project` soon!_

---

## 📖 Learnings & Takeaways

Throughout this bootcamp, I will reflect on:

- Key challenges and how I overcame them
- Ethical dilemmas in DeAI systems
- Technical and conceptual "aha!" moments
- Insights into decentralized infrastructure for AI

Reflections will be updated in the `/journal` folder.
